# ⚠️ Deprecated: Migration in Progress

This project version using **Next.js** is now **deprecated**. We are progressively migrating to **React Router v7**.

The migration is being carried out gradually, and some parts of the project are still using Next.js. Updates will be made progressively until the transition is complete.

For any questions, refer to the issue tracker.

Thank you for your understanding.
